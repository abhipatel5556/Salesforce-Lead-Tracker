UI Description – Lead Qualification Page

1. Visualforce Page: LeadQualificationPage.page
   - Displays detailed lead information.
   - Includes a “Qualify Lead” button for manual triggering.
   - Shows dynamic status and recommendations.

2. Apex Controller: LeadQualificationController.cls
   - Fetches lead data and binds it to the Visualforce page.
   - Handles UI button actions and invokes Apex logic.
   - Returns updated qualification results to the page dynamically.

Goal:
Provide an intuitive interface for sales reps to view, qualify, and manage leads efficiently without switching between multiple pages.
